## Background

- MTX may be the only drug necessary to control RA for some, but in 30-40% there is no response
- 50% of patients discontinue MTX within 3-5 years (Aletaha & Smolen, 2002)
- Composite disease activity measures reflect a clinically meaningful target of reaching low disease activity (see Van Gestel et al., 1996, Van Gestel et al., 1998, and Fransen & van Riel, 2005)

## Methods

- Demographic, clinical and genomic data of 643 european-ancestry patients with early RA
- Response to MTX was defined as good or moderate by the EULAR response criteria at the 3-month follow-up
- Random forests were trained and prediction performance was evaluated with AUC

## Results

- In-sample AUC 0.84, out-of-sample prediction accuracy 76% (with p values for both, lol?)
- Intergenic SNPs had variable importance above 60 (whatever that means), and among with **baseline DAS28** were the top predictors of MTX response

## Conclusion

- Pharmacogenomic biomarkers combined with baseline DAS28 can be useful in predicting response to MTX in patients with early RA
- ML is promising in this area, potentially able to predict timely escalation of treatment strategies in early RA
