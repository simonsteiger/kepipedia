## Methods

- Summarise new supporting or contradicting evidence for therapies
- Literature search and predefined voting process on current levels of evidence

## Results

- Task force agreed on five overarching principles and 12 recommendations concerning use of csDMARDs (MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalizine), glucocorticoids (GCs), bDMARDs (TNFis), and tsDMARDs (JAKis)
- Guidance on monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategy (treat-to-target) and tapering on sustained clinical remission is provided
	1. Begin with MTX plus GCs and upon insufficient response within 3 to 6 months, stratify by risk factors
	2. In the presence of poor prognostic factors (autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions or failure of two csDMARDs), any bDMARD or JAKi should be **added** to the csDMARD
	3. Add a bDMARD (another or same class) or tsDMARD is recommended

### Defining MTX failure

According to this definition, MTX treatment has been unsuccessful once a patient **adds** any bDMARD or JAKi.
Classifying initial treatment success for MTX in SRQ should therefore look for the **addition** of other drugs and not the stopping date of MTX.

:::

- On sustained remission, DMARDs may be tapered but not stopped
- Levels of agreement among experts were high mostly

## Conclusion
