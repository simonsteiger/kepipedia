## Background

- MTX is the popular first-line DMARD treatment in RA
- There are no clinically useful tools to predict response to MTX treatment in patients with RA

## Methods

- DMARD-naïve patients with RA from RCTs were accessed through a database
- Required **DAS28-ESR** at baseline and 12 and 24 weeks
- [Latent class modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model) of MTX response
- [Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) and [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) were used to identify predictors of response
- Model performance was assessed using [AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

## Results

- 775 patients from 4 RCTs were included
- Two classes of patients were identified based on DAS28-ESR **change** over 24 weeks: good vs poor responders
- Top predictors were baseline DAS28, ACPA, HAQ – highest likelihood of response in DAS28 < 7.4, ACPA positive, HAQ < 2
- Isn't this a bit of a no brainer? If you're doing better at the start, you're more likely to achieve a certain low threshold after a short amount of time? See also Capelusnik & Aletaha, 2021.

## Conclusions

- Developed and externally validated a prediction model for response to MTX within 24 weeks in DMARD-naïve patients with RA
- One of the first studies to use ML methods to identify latent trajectories of DAS28-ESR over 24 weeks

### Heterogeneous responses to MTX unaccounted for in treatment guidelines

The vast heterogeneity in response to MTX among individual patients with RA is **insufficiently addressed in the current treatment guidelines**, and systematic patient-tailored tools to personalize early RA management are lacking (for more information on treatment guidelines, see Smolen et al., 2020, Fraenkel et al., 2021).

:::

- Lower baseline disease activity and better functional status are predictive of good responders to MTX is in line with previous studies ([[Capelusnik & Aletaha, 2021]], [[Sergeant et al., 2018]], [[Castrejón et al., 2016]])
- Authors claim that people below certain cutoffs (see [[#Results]]) have an 80% probability of responding to MTX treatment, but it is unclear to me how much uncertainty there is on an individual level – after all, this prediction should only matter on an individual level

### More discussion

The authors go into further detail about
- Relevance of different time windows
- Relevance of ACPA positivity
- Relevance of individual DAS28 components for prediction and point to another study from the Netherlands where this was similar (see [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/11/1/44), yet to be summarised)
- Sociodemographic characteristics
- External validation of results
- Limitations and strengths of their study
