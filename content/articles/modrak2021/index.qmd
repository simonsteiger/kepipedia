## Background

- Lack of knowledge about effective treatments for COVID-19
- Existing methods for predicting COVID-19 severity are at high risk of bias

## Methods

- Convenience sample from 10 sites
- Data were available on daily resolution
- Multiverse analysis, which reports and compare different models to capture uncertainty about different models and its impact on the conclusions
- Among the models run is a Bayesian HMM using rates, restricted transitions, and terminal states implemented in `brms` with some added special sauce (for more detail, see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cas-bioinf/covid19retrospective) and a [post on the Stan discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/fitting-hmms-with-time-varying-transition-matrices-using-brms-a-prototype/19645))

## Results

- Mostly inconclusive results
- Adjusted models suggest that effect of some candidate treatments is spurious

## Conclusion

- Other studies on the analyzed treatments likely overestimated their effectiveness
