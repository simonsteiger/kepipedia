## Background

TODO

## Methods

- Analysed individual variables and indices at baseline
- Predicted remission at either 6 or 12 months according to Boolean remission, SDAI, CDAI and DAS28

## Results

- Remission was predicted "significantly" (?) in 27 to 51 percent of patients
- Relevant predictors were younger age, low scores (no brainer? see also Capelusnik & Aletaha, 2021) on composites and their components, HAQ, pain, etc
- Remission was not predicted by the absence of "poor prognosis RA" (meaning "difficult to treat RA"?) or radiographic erosions
- In multivariate regressions that included only three variables (sounds like some model selection?) low HAQ predicted remission according to all criteria as effectively as SJC, ESR, or CRP

## Conclusions

- Younger age and (low scores on) six core data set clinical measures predicted remission
- Absence of traditional "poor prognosis RA" indicators, RA, ACPA, or radiographic erosions did **not** predict remission
