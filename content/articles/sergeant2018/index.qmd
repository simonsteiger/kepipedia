## Background

- MTX is the DMARD of choice in anti-rheumatic treatment
- Response to MTX varies between patients

## Methods

- Participants from the UK multi-center prospective observational study RAMS (RA medication study)
- MTX-naïve patients
- Non-response was defined as "no response" after the EULAR response criteria (see also [Smolen et al., 2020](../smolen2020/index.qmd)), discontinuation of MTX due to **inefficacy** or **starting biologic therapy**
- Tested association of baseline demographic, clinical and psychosocial predictors with non-response using logistic regression
- AUC and calibration plots to assess predictive performance

## Results

- 43% of patients were classified as non-responders
- independent multivariable predictors of MTX non-response were RF negativity, higher HAQ, higher TJC, lower DAS28 and higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety score
- Optimism-corrected (huh?) AUC was 0.74

## Conclusions

- First MTX non-response model to be developed in a large cohort where MTX starters where analysed with demographic, clinical and psychosocial predictors
- Anxiety is a predictor of non-response and could be addressed at treatment commencement
