### At a glance

Objective
: To test wheter considering ultrasound measurements allow for the definition of stricter remission criteria, which ensure that patients in remission are free of [synovitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis).

## Background

## Methods

- Sample included patients with DAS28 $\leq$ 2.6 (implies DAS28ESR was used) for at least 6 months
- These patients were classified using standard DAS28-, more stringent DAS28-, and SDAI [cutoffs](../../epidemiology/cutoffs/index.qmd)
- Records of ultrasound were made to compare against clinical disease activity measures

## Results

- 128 patients receiving either DMARD _or_ DMARD and TNFi were included (median DAS28ESR 1.7, all < 2.6)
- Of 640 imaged joints, 5% had moderate or severe [power Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect#Medical) (PD) activity, 8% were clinically swollen, 1% were tender
- Moderate to severe PD activity was present in patients fulfilling DAS28ESR (21%), ACR (15%) or SDAI (19%) remission
- More stringent DAS28ESR and SDAI criteria reduced the mean number of swollen and tender joints, but not the percentage of patients with PD activity

## Conclusions

- Using more stringent remission criteria reduces symptoms of inflammation, but not PD activity in patients with remission
- Clinical criteria may be sufficiently insensitive (?) to detect low but clinically relevant levels of inflammation accurately
