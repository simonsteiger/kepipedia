# General

Since my school days, I have lacked confidence in writing mathematical notation.
This cheatsheet is here to remedy that!

The notations I list here is all but set in stone, but seems to be least one of the common ways to approach notation in this subject area.
It is adapted from Michael Betancourt's [blog](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/)

# Set notation

| Notation | Interpretation |
|:--------:|:--------|
| $X$ | The **ambient set** captures all objects of interest. |
| $x$ | A variable element in the ambient set $X$. |
| $x_n \in X$ | A specific element $x_n$ from the ambient set $X$. |
| $\text{x}$ | A variable subset of the ambient set $X$. |
| $X = \{\text{🥦, 🥫, 🥐}\}$ | A set with a finite number of elements. |
| $\text{x} \subset X$ | A **subset** of $X$. |
| $\text{x} \subseteq X$ | A subset potentially containing all elements of $X$. |
| $\text{x}'$ | A subset of another subset $\text{x}$. |
| $\emptyset = \{\}$ | The **empty set** which contains no elements at all. |
| $\{x_n\}$ | A subset with a single element is the **atomic set**[^1]. |
| $2^X$ | The **power set** of $X$ is the collection of all its subsets. |
| $\text{x} = \{\text{🥦}\}, \text{x}^c = \{\text{🥫, 🥐}\}$ | The **complement** $\text{x}^c$ of $\text{x}$ includes all $x_n \in X$ not already in $\text{x}$. |
| $\{\text{🥦, 🥫}\} \cup \{\text{🥫, 🥐}\} = \{\text{🥦, 🥫, 🥐}\}$ | A **union** includes all elements found in *either* subset. |
| $\{\text{🥦, 🥫}\} \cap \{\text{🥫, 🥐}\} = \{\text{🥫}\}$ | An **intersection** includes all elements found in *both* subsets. |
