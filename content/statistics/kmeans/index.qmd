# In a nutshell

This is my attempt at coding $K$-means from scratch. I have used the pseudocode from [this handout](https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/handouts/kmeans.html) on AI systems as a starting point but so far not looked into optimized solutions. I can already think of a few improvements which would affect efficiency though, so this version is certainly clunkier and slower than necessary. 🐢

Let's begin by describing the goal of $K$-means mathematically.

$$
\text{minimize} \ \sum_{i=1}^n \| \mathbf{x}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{z_i} \|^2 \ \text{w.r.t.} \ (\boldsymbol{\mu}, z)
$$

In this equation, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$ is the center of the $k$-th cluster, and
$z_i$ is an index of the cluster for $i$-th point $\mathbf{x}_i$.
I have also seen $K$-means being described as a *coordinate-descent* algorithm, but I am not yet deep enough into the terminology to understand that well.

# Coding K-means

I will start by laying out the general structure of the algorithm and then defining its components one by one.

## Main function

```julia
function kmeans(k, X; max_iter=1000, seed=42)
	
	# Dimensionality of the problem
	nfeatures, nobs = size(X)

	# Initialize random centroids and empty label vector
	initctr = initcentroids(nfeatures, k; seed)
	initlbl = Vector{Int64}(undef, nobs)

	# Track the state of the algorithm
	state = KmeansResult(k, X, initctr, initlbl, 0, seed, [], [])
	
	# Minimize Euclidean distance until convergence or maximum iterations
	while notconverged(state.log_centroids, state.iter, max_iter)

		# Assign labels to each observation based on centroid location
		assign!(state.labels, X, state.centroids)
		push!(state.log_labels, copy(state.labels))

		# Reposition centroids based on assigned observations
		reposition!(state.centroids, X, state.labels, k, state.iter)
		push!(state.log_centroids, copy(state.centroids))

		# Increment iteration counter
		state.iter += 1
	end

	# Warn if no convergence after reaching iteration limit
	state.iter == max_iter && @warn "Did not converge after $max_iter iterations."
	
	return state
end;
```

## Helper functions

Now that we've laid out the general logic we want the $K$-means algorithm to follow, we still need to craft a few tools to make it run.

First up is an object class (called a `struct` in Julia), which will allow us to track all relevant parameters of the algorithm in a single place. This will also be the result that is returned to the user.

In detail, we'll track and return the following:

- *k*, the number of clusters to be fit
- *X*, the matrix of the data to be clustered
- *centroids*, the final centroids of the clusters
- *labels*, the final labels of the observations
- *iter*, the number of iterations until the algorithm ended
- *seed*, the random seed used for cluster initialization
- *log_centroids*, a vector of centroid-matrices, for each iteration one matrix
- *log_labels*, a vector of label-vectors, for each iteration one vector

```julia
mutable struct KmeansResult
	k::Int64
	X::Matrix{Float64}
	centroids::Matrix{Float64}
	labels::Vector{Int64}
	iter::Int64
	seed::Int64
	log_centroids::AbstractArray
	log_labels::AbstractArray
end
```

> #### Why mutable struct?
> Unlike `mutable structs`, pure `structs` are immutable after creation, meaning that the values stored in each field cannot be altered. The pure version would be a poor choice in our case, since we want to update the state of the algorithm at each iteration step. Therefore, we need a `mutable struct`. This type is generally less memory efficient and comes with reduced performance, but we can't avoid it here (I think)!

### Initializing centroids

First, we need a function which initializes random centroids at the beginning of the algorithm (but it's also very useful as a reboot when one of our centroids ends up without any observations assigned to it! 🤫).

We'll use the `Xoshiro256++` pseudorandom number generator to manually set random seeds for initial centroids.

```julia
import Random: Xoshiro

initcentroids(d, k; seed=42) = randn(Xoshiro(seed), d, k);
```

### Checking convergence

We need a function which determines if the $K$-means algorithm has converged, or if it has reached the maximum number of iterations.

During each iteration, this function checks for three conditions.

##### 1. First iteration
The algorithm cannot converge during the first iteration (`itr < 2`) because we define convergence as the absence of change in centroids between two consecutive evaluations. Hence, we need a second iteration to evaluate convergence.

##### 2. Static centroids
I've already mentioned the second condition, which is that there is no change in centroids between two consecutive iterations. Since we want the condition to evaluate to `false`, we have to flip it and get `ctr[itr] ≠ ctr[itr-1]`.

##### 3. Maximum iterations
Finally, the algorithm should stop once it has reached the maximum number of iterations (`itr < max`).

```julia
notconverged(ctr, itr, max) = (itr < 2 || ctr[itr] != ctr[itr-1]) && itr < max;
```

Looking at the boolean algebra connecting these three conditions in the function above, we see that the algorithm will stop, i.e., `notconverged()` will return `false`, when *both* condition 1 and 2 evaluate to `false`, *or* when condition 3 evaluates to `false`.

### Calculating distances

The $K$-means algorithm uses Euclidean distances between the vector of the centroid(s) and each observation. We'll use a version of the formula which generalizes to higher dimensions.

$$
\Delta(p,q)={\sqrt {(p-q)^{2}}}
$$

```julia
euclidean(x, y) = √(sum((x .- y) .^ 2));
```

As it stands, this function will work well for calculating the distance between two vectors. What we really need though are pairwise distances between two sets of vectors, one being the observations and the other one being the centroids.

To help with this, I'll define a helper which makes the `euclidean()` function work as described.

```julia
function pairwise(f, x, y; dims=1)
	[f(i, j) for i in eachslice(x, dims=dims), j in eachslice(y, dims=dims)]
end;
```

### Assigning labels

We label each observation depending on which centroids it's closest to in Euclidean space.

This function could be improved because it is inefficient[^1] and could be prettier [^2].

```julia
function assign!(lab, X, ctr)
	Δ = pairwise(euclidean, X, ctr, dims=2)
	idxmin = findmin(Δ, dims=2)[2]
	[lab[i] = idxmin[i][2] for i in eachindex(idxmin)]
end;
```

### Repositioning centroids

In each iteration, we want to reposition the centroids to the means of the observations assigned to them.

This concept breaks down if one of the centroids is assigned no observations at all. In this scenario, we will reinitiate that centroid randomly and move to the next iteration.

```julia
import StatsBase: mean

function reposition!(c_new, X, labels, k, iter)
	for i in 1:k
		idx = labels .== i
		if all(!, idx)
			c_new[:, i] = initcentroids(size(c_new, 1), 1; seed=iter)
		else
			c_new[:, i] = [mean(r) for r in eachslice(X[:, idx], dims=1)]
		end
	end
end;
```

>#### Want a different random centroid?
>We'll have to use a different seed than the one `initcentroids()` uses by default! Otherwise, we would initiate a new centroid in exactly the same position as the one that failed us before. I have chosen to set the seed to `iter`, so even if the reinitiation fails repeatedly, the algorithm will try with a new centroid each time. Finally, if it never succeeds, the algorithm still stops at upon reaching the maximum number of iterations.

### Standardising features

Features passed to $K$-means must be standardised.

```julia
standardise(x) = (x .- mean(x)) ./ std(x);
```

So far so good! I think that's all we need.

# Simulating clusters

... before we can take our freshly baked $K$-means algorithm out for a spin, we first need to cook up some data to play with. We will draw this data from a mixture of gaussians.

You can customize the data-generating process regarding (as soon as I figure out how to hook up Pluto here)

1. The number of generated samples
2. The separation of the clusters
3. The number of clusters

Let's write down the recipe for this mixture of gaussians!

```julia
using Distributions, LinearAlgebra

function generate_multivariate_data(n, κ, separation; seed=42)
	# Pass seed to random number generator
	rng = Xoshiro(seed)

	# Samples are equally likely to belong to any of the clusters
	probvec = fill(1/κ, κ)
	switch = Categorical(probvec)

	# Create a Multivariate Normal with κ clusters (μ) and covariance Σ
	gaussians = map(1:κ) do idx
		angle = 2π / κ * (idx - 1)
		bas_v = separation * [1.0, 0.0]
		R 	  = [cos(angle) -sin(angle); sin(angle) cos(angle)]
		μ 	  = R * bas_v
		Σ     = Matrix(Hermitian(R * [10.0 0.0; 0.0 20.0] * R'))
		return MvNormal(μ, Σ)
	end

	# Sample true cluster membership of each observation from Categorical
	z = rand(rng, switch, n)
	
	# Initialise a vector to store the result
	y = Vector{Vector{Float64}}(undef, n)

	# Sample from Multivariate Normal
	for i in 1:n
		y[i] = rand(rng, gaussians[z[i]])
	end

	return y
end;
```

## Inspecting the data

~~Play around with the sliders to set the sample size, number of clusters, and cluster separation.~~ Then we'll use this data to test our new $K$-means algorithm!

```julia
using StatsPlots

X = reduce(hcat, generate_multivariate_data(3000, 4, 10))

histogram2d(X[1, :], X[2, :], bins=50)
```

> #### What does the input to _separation_ do?
> If you pay attention to the axes, you'll realize that this parameter simply stretches out the space in which the gaussians are located, thus pulling them apart or moving them closer together.

# Proving ground

Time to try our new $K$-means algorithm!

We first need to standardise the input matrix.

```julia
Z = standardise(X)
```

## And action!

We will fit five clusters to this data and set a seed.

```julia
k = 6;
seed = 42;
```

Time to fit!

```julia
fit = kmeans(k, Z, seed=seed);
```

We can inspect the result by looking at the different fields of `fit`. 
To check the final centroids, we would do the following:

```julia
fit.centroids
```

## Tracking K-means

Let's look at the steps the $K$-means algorithm takes to find its solution.

```julia
@gif for i in eachindex(fit.log_centroids)
	scatter(Z[1, :], Z[2, :], c=fit.log_labels[i], markershape=:xcross, legend=:none)
	scatter!(fit.log_centroids[i][1, :], fit.log_centroids[i][2, :], c=[1:k;])
	title!("Iteration $i")
	xlims!(-3, 3), ylims!(-3, 3)
end every 1 fps=15
```

[^1]: 🐢 This is currently updating the labels indiscriminately without checking if the centroid has changed at all. 

[^2]: 🪳 I don't like the way I'm accessing the `CartesianIndices` returned by `findmin()`. There is probably a better solution with `view()`.
